# Make a wish
**The project for my bachelor's degree** 

The "Make A Wish" platform brings harmony between technology and emotions. The general idea of this project is to provide a quick and user-friendly solution for users. The main goal of this platform is to make it easy for users to order a surprise delivery for a loved one, especially when they are separated by hundreds of kilometers. Additionally, it emphasizes creating a pleasant and memorable experience for users through functionality and design, incorporating some of the latest trends in web design.
